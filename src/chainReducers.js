/**
 * Chains multiple root reducers together.
 *
 * WARNING: Improper use of this function can be dangerous to performance and your state tree.
 * It is not recommend to use this with combineReducers() UNLESS combineReducers() contains all slice reducers required to construct state.
 * ALL reducer functions MUST return the state object passed to the function, or a new updated instance of state.
 * The state object is overwritten, not merged. NEVER return a partal state tree.
 * If your reducer does not need to update state, ALWAYS return the state object as-is.
 * Always treat the state object as immutable.
 *
 * @param {object} initialState Initial state object. Used in case provided state is undefined.
 * @param  {Function[]} reducers redux reducer functions
 * @returns {Function} Redux top-level reducer
